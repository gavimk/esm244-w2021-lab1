I am #blessed to get to look at SF trees, including Cole Valley trees, the best trees.

Below, I wrangle some data because Allison told me to. We'll find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal status, wrangle, and graph. 
```{r}

# read in SF trees data

sf_trees <- read_csv(here::here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))

# basic wrangling reminders

top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)
  

```
